# zoom.AppImage
Script to create zoom-linux AppImage for Slackware64-current

This script is an unofficial creator of AppImage for https://zoom.us/ since they dont provide one.

---
## HowTo
`bash slack-zoom2appimage`
Thats all... 

---


# NOTE:
You should NOT run AppImage from everyone (like me), only from official creators.
 This script will download and create an AppImage in a **Slackware64-current** system. 
 The reason is that official zoom.us dont provide AppImages for zoom...so far.
 
 zoom.us has nothing to do with this script. Use it at your own risk.
